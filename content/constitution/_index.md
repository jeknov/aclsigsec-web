# Constitution of the ACL Special Interest Group on NLP Security

## I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on NLP Security (the SIG) shall be to promote interest in security in natural language processing and security of natural language processing resources and techniques; to provide members of the ACL with a special interest in NLP security with a means of exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in the union of information security and computational linguistics; and to sponsor meetings and workshops in NLP Security that appear to be timely and worthwhile, operating within the framework of the ACL's general guidelines for SIGs.


## II. ELECTED OFFICERS

The elected officers of the SIG shall consist of a President, a Secretary and a Expert Advisor. The President and Secretary shall be members in good standing of the ACL. The Expert Advisor should be someone with an information security background.

The term of all elected officers of the SIG shall be two years.

The duties of the President shall be: (1) To have primary executive authority over actions and activities of the SIG. (2) To prepare a written report on the activities of the SIG for the Executive Committee of the ACL, for presentation to the ACL at its Annual Business Meeting. (3) To designate a Liaison Representative for the SIG, who shall be primarily responsible for communication with members of the SIG, answering inquiries about the SIG, and communication with the Executive Committee of the ACL. The Liaison Representative may be either a SIG officer or a SIG member.

The duties of the Secretary shall be: (1) To maintain a membership roster of the SIG. (2) To be responsible for any moneys awarded to the SIG by the ACL; to collect and manage any dues that may be required by the organization; and to present a written annual report on the SIG finances to the Executive Committee of the ACL. (3) To act as a Liaison Representative, who shall be primarily responsible for communication with members of the SIG, answering inquiries about the SIG, and communication with the Executive Committee of the ACL. (4) To maintain any discussion fora for the members. (5) To perform outreach, including on social media, about the SIG’s events.

The duties of the Expert Advisor shall be: (1) To advise the SIG leadership’s direction in bridging the ACL and Security communities. (2) To transfer knowledge from the security communities beyond ACL to the SIG and its members. (3) To promote the SIG, its activities, and its members’ activities in the security communities beyond ACL. (4) To serve a senior role in steering the SIG’s academic review and selection processes, for example on best paper committees, as a senior area chair, or reviewing/co-drafting calls for papers. In addition, the Expert Advisor should have industry links, and so at the start of their term they must hold at least one active affiliation that is not with an education organisation.

## III. ELECTION OF OFFICERS

All officers of the SIG shall be elected by a vote of the membership. The vote shall take place at least before the expiration of the terms of the officers to be elected, with at least 4 weeks' notice of nominations to SIG members. Votes will take place via email.

## IV. DUES
The SIG will not levy member dues.
