Information about the ACL SIG SEC

* ACL = Association for Computational Linguistics, the professional organisation for NLP and computational linguistics research
* SIG = Special Interest Group
* SEC = Security


We exist to (a) provide infrastructure and community for those many ACL members working in NLP Security; (b) to establish a serious research body that represents NLP and ACL interests in the burgeoning field of LLM and NLP security; (c) to bridge the Information Security and Computational Linguistics communities, which is a link already actively being pursued by the Information Security community.

We host regular talks on NLP & LLM Security, a mailing list for interested people, and a annual research workshop.
